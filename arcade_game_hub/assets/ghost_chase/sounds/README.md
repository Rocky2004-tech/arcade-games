# Sound Files for Ghost Chase

## Current Status
Most sound files in this directory are placeholders or corrupted. Only `orb_fixed.wav` is currently working properly.

## Required Sound Files
The game expects the following sound files:
- `orb_collect.wav` - Sound when collecting an orb
- `ghost_ping.wav` - Sound for ghost's sonar ping
- `chase_nearby.wav` - Sound when ghost is near the runner
- `win_theme.wav` - Sound when a round ends
- `ambient_loop.mp3` - Background ambient music

## How to Fix
To properly implement sounds in the game:

1. Replace the placeholder files with actual sound files in the appropriate format
2. Make sure all WAV files are in a format compatible with Pygame
3. For MP3 files, ensure your Pygame installation supports MP3 playback

## Temporary Solution
The game has been modified to use the working `orb_fixed.wav` file for all sound effects and to disable the ambient music. This is a temporary solution until proper sound files are added.
